Q1. The conditional operators in Java are:

== (equal to)
!= (not equal to)
> (greater than)
< (less than)
>= (greater than or equal to)
<= (less than or equal to)
Q2. Operators in Java can be classified into three types based on the number of operands:

Unary operators (e.g., !, -)
Binary operators (e.g., +, -, *, /, %)
Ternary operator (only one: ?:, the conditional operator)
Q3. The switch statement in Java is used for multi-way branching. It allows the program to execute different code blocks 
based on the value of an expression or variable.

Q4. Conditional statements in Java are used to control the flow of execution based on certain conditions. 
The commonly used conditional statements are if, else if, and else. They help in executing specific blocks of code based on the evaluation of conditions.

Q5.if (condition) {
    // code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
    // code to be executed if the condition is false
}

Q6.String str1 = "Hello";
String str2 = "World";

if (str1.equals(str2)) {
    // Strings are equal
} else {
    // Strings are not equal
}
Q7.In Java, strings are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed. However, using the StringBuilder class, you can create mutable strings.
Q8.import java.util.Arrays;

public class StringSortExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String input = "openai";
        char[] chars = input.toCharArray();
        Arrays.sort(chars);
        String sortedString = new String(chars);
        System.out.println(sortedString);
    }
}
Q9.public class LetterCheckExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String word = "Umbrella";
        boolean containsE = word.contains("e");
        if (containsE) {
            System.out.println("The word contains the letter 'e'.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("The word does not contain the letter 'e'.");
        }
    }
}
Q10. The string constant pool is located in the Java heap memory. It is a special area where string literals and interned strings are stored. 
The string pool allows efficient memory management by reusing string objects with the same value.
